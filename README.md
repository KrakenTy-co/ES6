# ES2015 (+ Angular 1.5)

This repo serves as a minimal starter for those looking to get up-and-running with Angular and ES6, using Gulp with Babel and Browserify for the build process.
It's a minimal starter with tasks for building the boilerplate.
Also is there some useful examples to illustrate how is ES6 different to ES5.

## ES2015
ECMAScript 6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the latest version of the ECMAScript standard. ES6 is a significant update to the language, and the first update to the language since ES5 was standardized in 2009. Implementation of these features in major JavaScript engines is [underway now](http://kangax.github.io/es5-compat-table/es6/).

## Angular
AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.

AngularJS is a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application development. It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries.
